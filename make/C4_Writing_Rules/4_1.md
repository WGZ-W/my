# 4.1 Rule Example
Here is an example of a rule:
```
foo.o : foo.c defs.h       # module for twiddling the frobs
        cc -c -g foo.c
```
Its target is foo.o and its prerequisites are foo.c and defs.h. It has one command in the recipe: ‘cc -c -g foo.c’. The recipe starts with a tab to identify it as a recipe.

#
它的目标是 foo.o，它的先决条件是 foo.c 和 defs.h。 它在配方中有一个命令：'cc -c -g foo.c'。 配方以一个 tab 开始，以将其识别为配方。
#

This rule says two things:
- How to decide whether foo.o is out of date: it is out of date if it does not exist, or if either foo.c or defs.h is more recent than it.
- How to update the file foo.o: by running cc as stated. The recipe does not explicitly mention defs.h, but we presume that foo.c includes it, and that is why defs.h was added to the prerequisites.

#
这个规则说明了两个事情：
- 如何判断 foo.o 是否过时：如果它不存在，或者 foo.c 或 defs.h 比它更新，则它已经过时。
- 如何更新文件 foo.o：按说明运行 cc。 配方没有明确提到 defs.h，但我们假设 foo.c 包含它，这就是为什么将 defs.h 添加到先决条件中的原因。
