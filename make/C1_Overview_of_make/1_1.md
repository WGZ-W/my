# 1.1 How to Read This Manual
If you are new to make, or are looking for a general introduction, 
read the first few sections of each chapter,skipping the later sections. 
In each chapter, the first few sections contain introductory or general 
information and the later sections contain specialized or technical information. 
The exception is the second chapter,An Introduction to Makefiles, 
all of which is introductory.  

#
如果你是一个新手，或者只是浏览基础的make介绍，那就去读每章的前几个章节，
跳过后面的章节。在每一章，前几个章节包含介绍和基础的信息，但是后面的章节，
包含特殊或者技术性信息。第二章是个例外，都是介绍。
